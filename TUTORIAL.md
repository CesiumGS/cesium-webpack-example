# CesiumJS and Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a popular and powerful tool for bundling JavaScript modules. It allows developers to structure their code and assets in an intuitive way and to load different kinds of files as needed with simple require statements. When building, it will trace code dependencies and pack these modules into one or more bundles that are loaded by the web browser. This tutorial is a good place to start if you’d like to use CesiumJS to develop a more advanced web application. If you’re new to Cesium and are looking to learn to build your first sample app, take a look at our [Getting Started Tutorial](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/cesiumjs-quickstart/).

You'll learn how to:
- Build a simple web app from the ground up using webpack
- Integrate the [Cesium npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cesium) into your web app

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of the command line, JavaScript, and web development.
- Node.js installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version.

## Initialize an App with npm

1. Create a new directory for your app.
2. Open a console window and navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm init` and enter in the requested details about your application. If you are unsure about any prompts, press `Enter` to use the default value. You can modify these details at any point in the `package.json` file that `npm init` creates.

## Create the App Code

1. Create a `src` directory for your app code. When you build the app, webpack will automatically produce distribution files in a directory named `dist`.
2. Create the files `index.html` and `index.js` in the `src` directory added in step 1.
3. Add the following code to `src/index.html`. This will serve as a boilerplate HTML page to get us started.
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
4. Add the following code to `src/index.js`. This will serve as our boilerplate JavaScript code.
    ```js
    console.log('Hello World!');
    ```
5. Create the file `src/css/main.css` and add the following css code
    ```css
    html, body, #cesiumContainer {	
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
    ```

## Install and Configure Webpack
1. Install webpack by running `npm install --save-dev webpack`. The files `package-lock.json` and `package.json` should appear in your main directory. You should also see a new folder in your main directory named `node_modules`.
2. Create the file `webpack.config.js` in your main directory. 
3. Define our webpack [configuration](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/configuration/) object by adding the following code to `webpack.config.js`
    ```js
    const path = require('path');

    const webpack = require('webpack');

    module.exports = {
        context: __dirname,
        entry: {
            app: './src/index.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: 'app.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        }
    };
    ```
    In this code, `context` specifies the base path for your files. `entry` is used to specify bundles and `src/index.js` is our entry point. Webpack will output the bundel `app.js` to the folder `dist`, that webpack will create at runtime.
4. Webpack loads everything like a module. [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#loaders) are used to load CSS and other asset files. Install the [style-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/#src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx), [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/), and [url-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/) using `npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader url-loader`. Feel free to install any other loaders you may need in the future. Loaders can be installed at any point during this process.
5. Update `webpack.config.js` by adding two `module.rules`. The first rule should support CSS files and the second rule should support other static files. For each rule, define `test` for the types of files to load and `use` to specify the list of loaders. `webpack.config.js` should look something like this.
    ```js
    const path = require('path');
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    module.exports = {
        context: __dirname,
        entry: {
            app: './src/index.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: 'app.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
            }, {
                test: /\.(png|gif|jpg|jpeg|svg|xml|json)$/,
                use: [ 'url-loader' ]
            }]
        }
    };
    ```
6. To define `index.html` and inject our bundle into that page you will be using a webpack [plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#plugins) called [html-webpack-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#plugins). Use the command `npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin` to install the necessary plugin.
7. Require html-webpack-plugin in `webpack.config.js` by adding it to the `plugins` section. Next, pass `src/index.html` as our `template`. Finally, specify the mode option for webpack by adding `mode: 'development'` to `webpack.config.js`.`webpack.config.js` should now look something like
    ```js
    const path = require('path');
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {
        context: __dirname,
        entry: {
            app: './src/index.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: 'app.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
            }, {
                test: /\.(png|gif|jpg|jpeg|svg|xml|json)$/,
                use: [ 'url-loader' ]
            }]
        },
        plugins: [
            new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                template: 'src/index.html'
            })
        ],
        mode: 'development'
    };
    ```

## Bundle the App

1. In `package.json`, define the scripts that we can call with `npm`. Add the `build` command.
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js"
    }
    ```
    If done correctly, `package.json` should look something like this.  
    ```json
    {
    "name": "cesiumjs-webpack-tutorial",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js"
    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "devDependencies": {
        "css-loader": "^6.2.0",
        "html-webpack-plugin": "^5.3.2",
        "style-loader": "^3.2.1",
        "url-loader": "^4.1.1",
        "webpack": "^5.50.0"
    }
    }
    ```

Please note that details of this json file will vary based on your selections in [step 3](#initialize-an-app-with-npm) of **Initialize an App with npm**.

2. Run the command `npm run build`. Install CLI for webpack if necessary. Webpack CLI can be installed using the command `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`.

3. Ensure that there are no errors and your output looks similar to
    ```
    $ npm run build

    > cesiumjs-webpack-tutorial@1.0.0 build
    > node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js

    asset app.js 1.22 KiB [emitted] (name: app)
    asset index.html 376 bytes [emitted]
    ./src/index.js 28 bytes [built] [code generated]
    webpack 5.50.0 compiled successfully in 86 ms
    ```
Please verify that the `app.js` bundle and `index.html` file are added to the `dist` folder.

## Run the Development Server

1. You will be using a [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to serve a development build and see our application in action. Run `npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server`.
2. Add a `start` script to `package.json`. This script should run the development server. Be sure to set the config file via the `--config` flag and use the `--open` flag to open the application in a a browser upon execution of the command. `package.json` should look something like
    ```json
    {
    "name": "cesiumjs-webpack-tutorial",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js",
        "start": "node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --config webpack.config.js --open"
    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "devDependencies": {
        "css-loader": "^6.2.0",
        "html-webpack-plugin": "^5.3.2",
        "style-loader": "^3.2.1",
        "url-loader": "^4.1.1",
        "webpack": "^5.50.0",
        "webpack-cli": "^4.7.2",
        "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.2"
    }
    }
    ```
3. Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser.
4. Verify that you see Hello World!

## Add CesiumJS to a Webpack App

CesiumJS is an open source JavaScript library for creating world-class 3D globes and maps. Thus, it is a rather large and complex library. In additional to JavaScript modules, it also includes static assets such as CSS, image, and json files. It includes web worker files to perform intensive calculations in separate threads. Unlike traditional npm modules, CesiumJS does not define an entry point because of the diverse ways in which the library is used. You will need to configure some additional options to use it with webpack.

First, define where CesiumJS is. This tutorial uses the source code, so webpack can include individual models and trace the dependencies. Alternatively, you can use the built (minified or unminified) version of CesiumJS. However, the modules are already combined and optimized, which gives us less flexibility.

### Install CesiumJS

1. Install the [Cesium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cesium) module from npm using the command `npm install --save-dev cesium`.
2. Add `sourcePrefix` to `output` compile multiline strings in Cesium. Redirect module requests when normal resolving fails using `fallback` as Webpack 5 no longer polyfiles Node.js core modules.
    ```js
    // The path to the CesiumJS source code
    const cesiumSource = 'node_modules/cesium/Source';
    const cesiumWorkers = '../Build/Cesium/Workers';
    const path = require('path');
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {
        context: __dirname,
        entry: {
            app: './src/index.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: 'app.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
            // Needed to compile multiline strings in Cesium
            sourcePrefix: ''
        },
        resolve: {
            fallback: { "https": false, "zlib": false, "http": false, "url": false },
            mainFiles: ['index', 'Cesium']
        },
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
            }, {
                test: /\.(png|gif|jpg|jpeg|svg|xml|json)$/,
                use: [ 'url-loader' ]
            }]
        },
        plugins: [
            new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                template: 'src/index.html'
            })
        ],
        mode: 'development',
    };
    ```

## Manage CesiumJS Static Files

1. Now, you must make sure the static CesiumJS asset, widget, and web worker files are served and loaded correctly. Use `copy-webpack-plugin` to copy static files to the `dist` directory as part of the build process. To do this run the command `npm install --save-dev copy-webpack-plugin` and updated the plugins array in `webpack.config.js`. `webpack.config.js` should now look like
    ```js
    // The path to the CesiumJS source code
    const cesiumSource = 'node_modules/cesium/Source';
    const cesiumWorkers = '../Build/Cesium/Workers';
    const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
    const path = require('path');
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {
        context: __dirname,
        entry: {
            app: './src/index.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: 'app.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
            sourcePrefix: ''
        },
        resolve: {
            fallback: { "https": false, "zlib": false, "http": false, "url": false },
            mainFiles: ['index', 'Cesium']
        },
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]
            }, {
                test: /\.(png|gif|jpg|jpeg|svg|xml|json)$/,
                use: [ 'url-loader' ]
            }]
        },
        plugins: [
            new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                template: 'src/index.html'
            }),
            // Copy Cesium Assets, Widgets, and Workers to a static directory
            new CopyWebpackPlugin({ 
                patterns: [
                    { from: path.join(cesiumSource, cesiumWorkers), to: 'Workers' },
                    { from: path.join(cesiumSource, 'Assets'), to: 'Assets' },
                    { from: path.join(cesiumSource, 'Widgets'), to: 'Widgets' }
                ]
            }),
            new webpack.DefinePlugin({
                // Define relative base path in cesium for loading assets
                CESIUM_BASE_URL: JSON.stringify('')
            })
        ],
        mode: 'development',
    };
    ```

## Incorporate CesiumJS Into Your Application 

1. Updated `index.js` with CesiumJS starter code:

    ```js
    import { Ion, Viewer, createWorldTerrain, createOsmBuildings, Cartesian3, Math } from "cesium";
    import "cesium/Build/Cesium/Widgets/widgets.css";
    import "../src/css/main.css"

    // Your access token can be found at: https://cesium.com/ion/tokens.
    // This is the default access token
    Ion.defaultAccessToken = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJlYWE1OWUxNy1mMWZiLTQzYjYtYTQ0OS1kMWFjYmFkNjc5YzciLCJpZCI6NTc3MzMsImlhdCI6MTYyNzg0NTE4Mn0.XcKpgANiY19MC4bdFUXMVEBToBmqS8kuYpUlxJHYZxk';

    // Initialize the Cesium Viewer in the HTML element with the `cesiumContainer` ID.
    const viewer = new Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
        terrainProvider: createWorldTerrain()
    });

    // Add Cesium OSM Buildings, a global 3D buildings layer.
    viewer.scene.primitives.add(createOsmBuildings());   

    // Fly the camera to San Francisco at the given longitude, latitude, and height.
    viewer.camera.flyTo({
    destination : Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-122.4175, 37.655, 400),
    orientation : {
        heading : Math.toRadians(0.0),
        pitch : Math.toRadians(-15.0),
    }
    });
    ```
    This code initializes the Cesium Viewer, adds Cesium OSM Buildings to the terrain, and moves the `Camera` to San Francisco. 
2. Update `index.html` with the CesiumContainer
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="cesiumContainer"></div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
3. Run the command `npm run build`. Ensure that the project is built correctly.
4. Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser to see the CesiumJS viewer.

# Advanced Webpack Configurations and Resources

Webpack can be leveraged in many more ways to increase performance, decrease your bundle size, and perform additional or complex build steps. Here we’ll discuss a few configuration options relevant to using the CesiumJS library.

## Enable Source Maps

Source maps allow webpack to trace errors back to the original content. They offer more or less detailed debugging information in exchange for compiling speed. We recommend setting `devtool` to the 'eval' option in `webpack.config.js`

``` devtool: 'eval' ```

Please note that source maps are not recommended for production code.

## Additional Resources
